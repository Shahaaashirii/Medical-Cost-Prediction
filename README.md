# Medical Cost Prediction

This project aims to predict medical insurance costs based on personal information such as age, BMI, smoking status, etc. using Linear Regression and Random Forest models. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle.

## Project Features
- Data Cleaning
- Data Normalization (Box-Cox Transformation)
- Random Forest
- Evaluation using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R²

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/medical-cost-prediction.git
    ```
2. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook to train the model and make predictions.

## Results
The model achieved the following performance:
MAE: 0.1404510441114034
MSE: 0.07186038594076008
RMSE: 0.2680678756224999
R²: 0.8486800542009859
